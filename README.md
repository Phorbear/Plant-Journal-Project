"Final Project - APIs\n\nThis API will be part of a larger project to build an interactive, educational app. The goal of this assignment will be to build an API which assists in building and maintaining the journal database for the larger app. The primary function of this API will be the addition and modification of plants and their observed features and locations to take notes of plant observations for plant identification and taxonomy. The initial Entities will be users, entries, plants, and locations. A user will have access to their "Journal", the database of entries, plants and locations. They can search by location, or plant name to view the objects and their associated entries. They can additionally fill out additional entries which will add or update existing locations and plants. For simplicity, each entry may only consist of one plant and one location.\n\nFor more information please see the ERD in resources or the attached PDF Final Project Design.pdf"
